                    <h2>Diabloceratops eatoni</h2>
                    <hr>
                </header>
                <p>The only two specimens of Diabloceratops eatoni were recovered at the Wahweap Formation, in Kane County, Utah. 
                    Type specimen <code>UMNH VP 16699</code> was collected by Don DeBlieux in 2002, at the Last Chance Creek locality of this formation, 
                    in intraclastic sandstone that was deposited during the Campanian stage of the Cretaceous period, approximately 81 to 76 million years ago. 
                    It consists of a partial skull with a piece of the lower jaw, with the right side being intact and part of the left side, which has been weathered. 
                    Another specimen <code>UMNH VP 16704</code> was discovered years earlier in 1998 by Joshua A. Smith of the same formation, but was not described until 2010, 
                    when it was assigned to Diabloceratops. These specimens are housed in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Utah.</p>
                <p>Diabloceratops was built like a typical ceratopsian in that it had a large neck frill made of bone. It had a small horn on the nose, 
                    perhaps a second horn in front of that, and a pair of relatively small horns above the eyes. The skull is deeper and shorter than that of any 
                    other centrosaurines. Upon the frill it also had a pair of very long spikes as in Einiosaurus and Styracosaurus. It being one of the earliest 
                    centrosaurine ceratopsids, Kirkland noted a character Diabloceratops shared with the more "primitive" protoceratopsid forms. Both possess an 
                    accessory opening in the skull that would become much reduced or disappear in later, more advanced ceratopsids. Kirkland saw this as an indication 
                    that the earlier species were not together included in some single natural group but instead presented a gradual sequence of ever more derived forms, 
                    increasingly closer related to the Ceratopsidae.</p>

                </header>
                <p>The holotype skull is approximately 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) in length. Its body length has been estimated at 4.5 metres (14.8 ft), its weight at 
                    1.5 tonnes (1.7 short tons). Nasutoceratops has several unique derived traits or autapomorphies. The part of the snout around the nostril 
                    is strongly developed, representing about three quarters of the skull length in front of the eye sockets. The rear of each nasal bone is 
                    hollowed out by a large internal cavity. The contact surface between the maxilla and the praemaxilla is exceptionally large. 
                    The maxilla also has a large internal flange contacting the praemaxilla via two horizontal facets. The brow horns at their bases are pointed 
                    forwards and outwards, then curve inwards, and ultimately twist their points upwards.</p>
                <p>The snout of Nasutoceratops was short and high; its nasal bones exhibit internal cavities that the authors consider to 
                    represent pneumatic excavations, invading the bone from the nasal cavity. This is noteworthy because pneumatic nasals are unknown 
                    in any other ceratopsid, which supports that this feature represents a unique derived trait of this genus. Nasutoceratops had as many as 
                    29 tooth positions in the maxilla, each occupied by several stacked teeth. The skull roof between the eye sockets is vaulted and is markedly 
                    higher than the snout region. The curved horizontally projecting brow horn arrangement was likened to that of modern cattle by paleontologist 
                    David Hone. The brow horns span approximately 40% of the total length of the skull, almost reaching the level of the snout tip, 
                    and with a bone core length of up to 457 millimetres are the longest known of any centrosaurine, both in absolute and relative terms.</p>

                    <hr>
                </header>
                <p>Sinoceratops was a medium-sized, averagely-built, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore. It could grow up to an estimated 6 m (19.7 ft) 
                    length and 2 metres (6.6 ft) height, and weigh up to 2 tonnes (2.0 long tons; 2.2 short tons). It was the first ceratopsid dinosaur 
                    discovered in China, and the only ceratopsid known from Asia. All other centrosaurines, and all chasmosaurines, are known from 
                    fossils discovered in North America, except for possibly Turanoceratops. Sinoceratops is also significant because it is one of the 
                    largest known centrosaurines, and is much larger than any other known basal members of this group.</p>
                <p>The holotype specimen <code>ZCDM V0010</code>, consisting of a partial skull, including a braincase, was in the summer of 2008 recovered 
                    at the Xingezhuang Formation of the Wangshi Group in Shandong, China. The specimen was collected in fluvial sediments that 
                    were deposited during the Campanian-Maastrichtian stages of the Cretaceous period, approximately 72â€“66 million years ago.
                    Two other specimens have been recovered from the same formation. Specimen <code>ZCDM V0011</code> is a partial skull that consists of the skull 
                    roof and most of the braincase, and <code>ZCDM V0012</code> represents a partial braincase.</p>
                <p>Sinoceratops was a larger ceratopsian ornithischian, with an estimated length of about 6 metres (19.7 ft), weight of 2 tonnes 
                    (2.0 long tons; 2.2 short tons), and height of about 2 metres (6.6 ft). Thomas R. Holtz Jr. estimated its length at 7 metres 
                    (23 ft) and weight at 2.3 tonnes (2.3 long tons; 2.5 short tons), the weight of a rhinoceros. It has a short, hooked horn on its 
                    nose (called a nasal horn), no horns above its eyes (brow horns), and a short neck frill with a series of forward-curving hornlets 
                    that gave the frill a crown-like appearance. Inside this row of hornlets there is a series of low knobs on the top of the frill, 
                    which are not seen in any other horned dinosaur. Sinoceratops is a member of the short-frilled ceratopsids, the Centrosaurinae. 
                    Holotype specimen <code>ZCDM V0010</code> consists of a partial skull with most elements of the skull roof and partial braincase. 
                    The skull of Sinoceratops is estimated to be 180 cm (5.9 ft) long making it one of the largest known centrosaurine skulls.</p>

                    <h2>Medusaceratops lokii</h2>
                    <hr>
                </header>
                <p>The name Medusaceratops was coined by Canadian paleontologist Michael J. Ryan of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in 2003 in a 
                    dissertation. Its fossils were subsequently confused with those of Albertaceratops, another centrosaurine ceratopsian from Alberta 
                    which had been described by Ryan in 2007. Later, Ryan realized that the Mansfield Bonebed fossils did not belong to Albertaceratops. 
                    Medusaceratops was formally described and name by Michael J. Ryan, Anthony P. Russell and Scott Hartman in 2010 and the type species 
                    is Medusaceratops lokii. The generic name refers to Medusa, a monster from Greek mythology whose "hair" consists of snakes and its 
                    gaze could turn men to stone, alluding to a unique trait of this genus - the large, thick snake-like spikes that extend to the sides of the frill, 
                    in combination with Latinized Greek ceratops, meaning "horned-face", which is a common suffix for ceratopsian genera names. 
                    The specific name lokii honors Loki, a troublemaking god in the Norse mythology, in reference to the years confusion 
                    that surrounded the taxonomic designations of the Mansfield Bonebed material before it was given its own name.</p>
                <p>Upon its original description Medusaceratops was thought to represent a chasmosaurine. It was suggested that based on its type material alone, 
                    Medusaceratops is unique among Chasmosaurinae in having only three epiparietals (frill spikes) on each side of the frill. The first frill spike 
                    pair is large and the second is smaller, and both are uniquely widened at base, pachyostotic, curve down the sides of the frill, and are depressed 
                    down the front of the frill. The third frill spike pair is small and triangular, unmodified in comparison to early chasmosaurines, but similarly depressed,
                     and borders the squamosal bone. The highly broadened and curved first frill spike pair of Medusaceratops closely resembles the third pair of the frill 
                     ornamentation of Albertaceratops, however Medusaceratops was thought to differ (like all chasmosaurines) 
                    in lacking tab-shaped, frequently overlapping fourth to seventh pairs of the frill ornamentation of centrosaurines.</p>

                    <h2>Einiosaurus procurvicornis</h2>
                    <hr>
                </header>
                <p>In 1994, Sampson, in a talk during the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, named Horner's "Taxon B" as a new genus and species, 
                    Einiosaurus procurvicornis. Although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description, making the name valid, it did not yet identify by 
                    inventory number a holotype, a name-bearing specimen. The same abstract named Type C as Achelousaurus horneri. In 1995, Sampson published a 
                    larger article, indicating the holotype. The generic name Einiosaurus is derived from the Blackfeet eini, "American bison", and Latinised Greek 
                    saurus, "lizard". The name was chosen to honour the Blackfeet tribe but also to reflect the fact that ceratopids were, in Sampson's words,
                    "the buffalo of the Cretaceous", living in herds and having a complex life. 
                    According to Sampson, the name should be pronounced as "eye-knee-o-saurus". The specific name is derived from Latin procurvus, 
                    "bent forwards", and cornu, "horn", referring to the forwards curving nasal horn.</p>
                <p>In 1995, Sampson indicated several distinguishing traits. The nasal horn has a base that is long from front to rear, is transversely 
                    flattened, and is strongly curved forwards in some adult specimens. The supraorbital "brow" horns as far as they are present are low 
                    and rounded with a convex surface on the inner side. The parietal parts of the rear edge of the skull frill together bear a single 
                    pair of large curved spikes sticking out to behind. Einiosaurus differs from all other known Centrosaurinae by a longer-based and more procurved 
                    nasal horn and by a supraorbital horn that is longer-based and more rounded in side view. 
                    It differs from Achelousaurus in particular in having large parietal spikes that are not directed sideways to some extent.
                    As a centrosaurine, Einiosaurus walked on all fours, had a large head with a beak, a moderately large skull frill, a short powerful neck, 
                    heavily muscled forelimbs, a high torso, powerful hindlimbs and a relatively short tail.</p>

                    <hr>
                </header>
                <p>The massive bodies of Centrosaurus were borne by stocky limbs, although at up to 5.5 metres (18 ft) they were not particularly large dinosaurs.
                     Like other centrosaurines, Centrosaurus bore single large horns over their noses. These horns curved forwards or backwards depending on the 
                     specimen. Skull ornamentation was reduced as animals aged. The frill was relatively short compared to the total skull length, and could grow to 
                     over half a meter (68.8 cm) long in the oldest and largest adults. Centrosaurus is distinguished by having two large hornlets which hook forwards 
                     over the frill. A pair of small upwards directed horns is also found over the eyes. The frills of Centrosaurus were moderately long, with fairly 
                     large fenestrae and small hornlets along the outer edges.</p>
                <p>Like other ceratopsids, the jaws of Centrosaurus were adapted to shear through tough plant material. The discovery of gigantic bone beds of 
                    Centrosaurus in Canada suggest that they were gregarious animals and could have traveled in large herds. A bone bed composed of Centrosaurus 
                    and Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation in what is now Alberta. The mass deaths may have been caused by otherwise 
                    non-herding animals gathering around a waterhole during a drought. Centrosaurus is found lower in the formation than Styracosaurus, 
                    indicating that Centrosaurus was displaced by Styracosaurus as the environment changed over time.</p>
                <p>The large frills and nasal horns of the ceratopsians are among the most distinctive facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function has been the 
                    subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered. Common theories concerning the function of ceratopsian frills and horns include 
                    defense from predators, combat within the species, and visual display. A 2009 study of Triceratops and Centrosaurus skull lesions found that bone 
                    injuries on the skulls were more likely caused by intraspecific combat (horn-to-horn combat) rather than predatory attacks. The frills of 
                    Centrosaurus were too thin to be used for defense against predators, although the thicker, solid frills of Triceratops might have evolved to 
                    protect their necks. The frills of Centrosaurus were most likely used "for species recognition and/or other forms of visual display".</p>

                    <hr>
                </header>
                <p>The first fossil remains of Styracosaurus were collected in Alberta, Canada by C.M. Sternberg (from an area now known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, 
                    in a formation now called the Dinosaur Park Formation) and named by Lawrence Lambe in 1913. This quarry was revisited in 1935 by a Royal Ontario 
                    Museum crew who found the missing lower jaws and most of the skeleton. These fossils indicate that S. albertensis was around 5.5 to 5.8 meters in 
                    length and stood about 1.65 meters high at the hips. An unusual feature of this first skull is that the smallest frill spike on the left side 
                    is partially overlapped at its base by the next spike. It appears that the frill suffered a break at this point in life and was shortened by about 
                    6 centimeters (2.4 inches). The normal shape of this area is unknown because the corresponding area of the right side of the frill was not recovered.</p>
                <p>Individuals of the genus Styracosaurus were approximately 5.5 metres (18 ft) long as adults and weighed around 2.7 tonnes. The skull was massive,
                     with a large nostril, a tall straight nose horn, and a parietosquamosal frill (a neck frill) crowned with at least four large spikes. 
                     Each of the four longest frill spines was comparable in length to the nose horn, at 50 to 55 centimetres (20 to 22 inches) long. 
                     The nasal horn was estimated by Lambe at 57 centimeters (22 inches) long in the type specimen, but the tip had not been preserved. 
                     Based on other nasal horn cores from Styracosaurus and Centrosaurus, this horn may have come to a more rounded point at around half of that length.</p>

                </header>
                <p>The largest Pachyrhinosaurus species were 8 metres (26 ft) long. It weighed about four tonnes. They were herbivorous and possessed strong cheek 
                    teeth to help them chew tough, fibrous plants. Instead of horns, their skulls bore massive, flattened bosses; a large boss over the nose and a 
                    smaller one over the eyes. A prominent pair of horns grew from the frill and extended upwards. The skull also bore several smaller horns or ornaments 
                    that varied between individuals and between species. In P. canadensis and P. perotorum, the bosses over the nose and eyes nearly grew together, 
                    and were separated only by a narrow groove. In P. lakustai, the two bosses were separated by a wide gap. In P. canadensis and P. lakustai, the frill 
                    bore two additional small, curved, backward-pointed horns. These were not present in P. perotorum, and in fact some specimens of P. lakustai also 
                    lack them, which may indicate that the presence of these horns varied by age or sex.</p>
                <p>Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis, was described in 1950 by Charles Mortram Sternberg based on the holotype incomplete skull <code>NMC 8867</code>, and the paratype 
                    incomplete skull <code>NMC 8866</code>, which included the anterior part of the skull but was lacking the right lower mandible, and the "beak". These skulls 
                    were collected in 1945 and 1946 from the sandy clay of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta, Canada. In the years to come, additional material 
                    would be recovered at the Scabby Butte locality of the St. Mary River Formation near Lethbridge, Alberta, from terrestrial sediments considered to be 
                    between 74 and 66 million years old. These were among the first dinosaur sites found in the province, in the 1880s. The significance of these 
                    discoveries was not understood until shortly after World War II when preliminary excavations were conducted.</p>
                <p>During the first few years of development, P. perotorum show extremely rapid growth. When the animals were one year old, they had already 
                    reached 28% of their adult body size. By age two, they were almost half the size of a mature adult. However, the rate of growth slows 
                    considerably after that, and maximum size is not fully attained until about age twenty. The development of characteristics useful in sexual 
                    selection, including competition between males, such as pronounced nasal bosses, occurred at approximately nine years of age. This presumably 
                    corresponds to the age of sexual maturity.</p>
